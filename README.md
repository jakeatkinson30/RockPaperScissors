RockPaperScissors
A Rock, Paper, Scissors Game which puts you, the user, up against the computer. 

The aim of this project was to practice my newly acquired Javascript skills. I made use of the Math.random function to provide the Computers' throw and allowed for user input. 

The styles for this project are basic as Javascript was the main focus here. I intend to return to this project at a later date to improve the styling here.

I am aware of a few bugs present at current and will be returning in the near future to iron these out - specifically an issue with an incorrect user input and the text it displays, and an issue with the computer's turn still running if an incorrect user input is entered.
